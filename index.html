							<h3>Manjaro</h3>
						</div>
						<p>
							Is an accessible, friendly, open-source operating system.
							Providing all the benefits of cutting-edge software combined with
							a focus on getting started quickly, automated tools to require
							less manual intervention, and help readily available when needed.
							Manjaro is suitable for both newcomers and experienced computer
							users.
						</p>

						<p>
							Unlike proprietary operating systems you have full control over
							your hardware without restrictions. This makes Manjaro a powerful
							Operating System ideal in home, work, and development
							environments.
						</p>

						<p>
							It is easily possible to run many popular Windows applications,
							using compatibility software such as Wine, PlayonLinux or Proton
							via Steam. The examples given here are far from comprehensive!
						</p>
						<p>
							Representing a perfect middle-ground for those who want good
							performance, full control, and cutting-edge software but also a
							degree of software stability.

							<h3>Ubuntu</h3>
						</div>
						<h4>Open source</h4>
						<p>
							Ubuntu has always been free to download, use and share. We believe
							in the power of open source software; Ubuntu could not exist
							without its worldwide community of voluntary developers.
						</p>

						<h4>Secure</h4>

						<p>
							With a built-in firewall and virus protection software, Ubuntu is
							one of the most secure operating systems around. And the long-term
							support releases give you five years of security patches and
							updates.
						</p>

						<h4>Accessible</h4>

						<p>
							Computing is for everyone regardless of nationality, gender or
							disability. Ubuntu is fully translated into over 50 languages and
							includes essential assistive technologies.
						</p>

						<h4>Available on the largest range of hardware, ever</h4>

						<p>
							Canonical works closely with Dell, Lenovo and HP to certify that
							Ubuntu works on a wide range of their laptops and workstations. It
							means that a seamless Ubuntu experience is available out of the
							box with more hardware choice than ever.
						</p>

						<p>
							And Ubuntu isn’t just for the desktop, it is used in data centres
							around the world powering every kind of server imaginable and is
							by far, the most popular operating system in the cloud.

							<h3>Pop!_OS</h3>
						</div>
						<p>
							Pop!_OS is an operating system for STEM and creative professionals
							who use their computer as a tool to discover and create. Unleash
							your potential on secure, reliable open source software. Based on
							your exceptional curiosity, we sense you have a lot of it.
						</p>

							<h4>Auto-Tiling With Pop Shell</h4>

							<p>
								Pop!_OS uses auto-tiling for the same reason that people hire
								assistants: Organizing your work is incredibly time-consuming.
								Sure, you could still move, resize, and arrange windows
								yourself, but why spend the time when your OS does it for you?
								Auto-tiling helps you be both organized and efficient, and is
								especially convenient on large displays.
							</p>
						</div>

						<!-- wraps each paragraph in the article -->
						<div class="pops-article-text">
							<h4>Workspaces</h4>

							<p>
								Keep relevant content together and irrelevant content out of
								sight. When the clutter overwhelms you, just toss it onto
								another desktop. Problem solved.
							</p>
						</div>

						<!-- wraps each paragraph in the article -->
						<div class="pops-article-text">
							<h4>Keyboard Navigation</h4>

							<p>
								Arm yourself with a dark-lord level of power at your fingertips.
								Use keyboard shortcuts to:
							</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Move/resize windows</li>
								<li>Search for anything</li>
								<li>Launch applications</li>
							</ul>
						</div>

						<!-- wraps each paragraph in the article -->
						<div class="pops-article-text">
							<h4>Stacking</h4>
							<p>
								Stack application windows atop one another like tabs in a web
								browser. Just remember to switch off of Steam when the boss
								walks in.

							Most things Linux are open source. This means the source code for

							running on the Playstation 5. It's a team effort where everyone
